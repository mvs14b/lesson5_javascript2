### Student Name:  
(Michael Shapley)

### Project Description:
(This project was all about learning how to edit and change code in order to get a tax calculator to work. You had to realize how to not only edit the code for different calculations, but also make sure the tax calculator worked for people with a different filing status.)

### View Project:
()

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned that a calculator can function, but not fully unless the different filing options have the correct code. The calculator is useless to everyone that is not filing under single if the code is not properly edited. )
2. (I learned that a certain button on a web page might work for one status, but could be out of order for another filing status, thus making the whole web page to malfunction in a certain way.)
3. (I learned that the code for any type of calculator on a web page has to be flawless otherwise the calculator will be of no help to the users. )
